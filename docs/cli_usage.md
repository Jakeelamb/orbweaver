# Orbweaver CLI Usage Guide

This document provides comprehensive information about using the Orbweaver command-line interface.

## Basic Usage

```bash
./orbweaver -i <input_fasta> [other_options]
```

Outputs will be generated in a directory structure like `./<species_id>/<run_id>/` where `<species_id>` is derived from the input FASTA filename (the part before the extension, e.g., `my_genome` from `my_genome.fasta`) and `<run_id>` is either a timestamp or provided via `--run-id`. This output directory is created in the current working directory.

## Command-Line Options

### Input and Output

Key input/output behavior:
- **Input File**: `-i, --input-files <FILES>` is required. Multiple files can be comma-separated.
- **Species ID for Output**: Automatically derived from the filename of the *first* input file (e.g., `input.fasta` results in a species ID of `input`). This ID is used to name the primary output subdirectory.
- **Output Directory Structure**: All outputs are placed in a run-specific directory. This directory is created in the current working directory (where `orbweaver` is executed) and follows the pattern: `./<derived_species_id>/<run_id>/`.
- **Run ID**: Specified with `--run-id <ID>` or defaults to a timestamp (e.g., `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`). This ID forms the final part of the output directory path.
- **Default Output Files**: If specific paths are not provided for the following output types, they will be generated with default names within the run-specific directory:
    - `grammar.json` (JSON grammar)
    - `rules.fasta` (FASTA rule blocks)
    - `repeats_summary.tsv` (Tabular repeats summary)
    - `grammar.dot` (DOT graph for visualization)
    - `grammar.graphml` (GraphML graph format)

## Feature Details

### Rule Inlining

Rule inlining reduces grammar complexity by recursively expanding rules that are used only once. This optimization happens automatically during grammar construction and:

- Improves representation efficiency
- Removes unnecessary levels of indirection
- Simplifies the resulting grammar

### Rule Eviction

When `--max-rule-count` is specified, Orbweaver will maintain a limit on the number of rules:

- Rules with the lowest usage counts are evicted first
- Evicted rules are inlined at their usage points
- This prevents memory growth in large genomes
- Recommended for genomes > 100MB

Example:
```bash
orbweaver -i large_genome.fasta --max-rule-count 10000
```

### Chunked Grammar Construction

For very large genomes, Orbweaver can process the sequence in chunks:

- Specify `--chunk-size` to enable chunked processing
- Each chunk is processed while maintaining the global grammar
- Chunks overlap by `--chunk-overlap` bases to preserve patterns at boundaries
- Significantly reduces memory usage for large genomes

Example:
```bash
orbweaver -i large_genome.fasta --chunk-size 1000000 --chunk-overlap 10000
```

### Streaming Mode

Streaming mode processes sequences without loading the entire file into memory:

- Enabled with the `--streaming` flag
- Reads and processes the FASTA file incrementally
- Ideal for very large genomes where memory is limited
- Can be combined with chunking and rule eviction

Example:
```bash
orbweaver -i huge_genome.fasta --streaming --max-rule-count 5000
```

### Adaptive Chunking

Adaptive chunking dynamically adjusts chunk sizes based on sequence complexity:

- Enabled with the `--adaptive-chunking` flag
- Analyzes sequence entropy to determine optimal chunk sizes
- Balances processing speed and memory usage
- Works best with `--max-memory-per-chunk-mb` to set memory constraints

Example:
```bash
orbweaver -i complex_genome.fasta --adaptive-chunking --max-memory-per-chunk-mb 1000
```

### Multi-Sequence Processing

Orbweaver can process specific sequences from multi-FASTA files:

- Use `--sequence-indices` with a comma-separated list of indices (0-based)
- Processes only the specified sequences, skipping others
- Useful for selective analysis of multi-genome files

Example:
```bash
orbweaver -i multiple_genomes.fasta --sequence-indices 0,2,5 -j output.json
```

## Memory Usage Considerations

Orbweaver can process large genomic sequences efficiently using several memory-optimization techniques:

### 2-Bit Encoding

By default, Orbweaver uses 2-bit encoding for DNA sequences (A=00, C=01, G=10, T=11), reducing memory usage by up to 75% compared to storing sequences as ASCII characters. This encoding is controlled by the `--use-encoding` flag.

For extremely large genomes (100MB+), use the memory-optimized workflow:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh memory --input=large_genome.fasta
```

This workflow:
- Uses 2-bit encoding
- Sets conservative rule parameters
- Automatically calculates appropriate memory limits
- Provides additional error handling for out-of-memory situations

### When to Use Memory Optimization

| Genome Size | Recommended Workflow |
|-------------|---------------------|
| < 10 MB | `basic` workflow (default) |
| 10-100 MB | Use `--use-encoding true` flag |
| 100 MB - 1 GB | `memory` workflow with `--max-rule-count` |
| 1 GB - 10 GB | `memory` workflow with `--streaming` and `--max-rule-count` |
| > 10 GB | `memory` workflow with `--streaming`, `--adaptive-chunking`, and `--max-memory-per-chunk-mb` |

## Grammar Hierarchy Analysis

Orbweaver tracks rule hierarchy depth information:

- Maximum rule depth (height of the grammar tree)
- Average rule depth (complexity measure)
- This information is displayed when using `--stats`

## Examples

### Basic Usage (Single File)
```bash
# Species ID will be 'my_genome', output in ./my_genome/<timestamp>/
# Default outputs (grammar.json, rules.fasta, etc.) will be generated there.
./orbweaver --input-files my_genome.fasta --stats
```

### Basic Usage (Multiple Files)
```bash
# Species ID will be derived from 'file1', output in ./file1/<timestamp>/
# All files (file1.fa, file2.fa) are processed into one grammar (merging logic applies).
./orbweaver --input-files file1.fa,file2.fa --stats
```

### Specifying a Custom Run ID
```bash
# Output in ./my_genome/first_attempt/
./orbweaver --input-files my_genome.fasta --run-id first_attempt --stats
```

### Specifying an Output Filename (within the run-specific directory)
```bash
# grammar.json will be in ./my_genome/<timestamp>/custom_grammar.json
# Other defaults (rules.fasta, etc.) will be in ./my_genome/<timestamp>/ with default names.
./orbweaver --input-files my_genome.fasta --output-json custom_grammar.json
```

### Complete Analysis with All Outputs (using default names in run-specific dir)
```bash
# Species ID derived from my_genome_run.fasta. Output in ./my_genome_run/all_out/
# All of the following files will be created in ./my_genome_run/all_out/ with default names
# (e.g., grammar.json, rules.fasta) because only flags enabling them are given,
# or they are default outputs.
# If you wanted custom names, you'd provide them (e.g., --output-text my_text.txt)
./orbweaver --input-files my_genome_run.fasta --run-id all_out \
  --output-json \
  --output-text \
  --output-gfa \
  --visualize \
  --export-blocks \
  --output-repeats \
  --output-graphml \
  --stats
```

### Memory-Efficient Processing of Large Genomes
```bash
# Output will be in ./large_genome/<timestamp>/
./orbweaver --input-files large_genome.fasta --use-encoding true --min-rule-usage 5 --stats --streaming
```

### Rule Eviction for Memory Optimization
```bash
orbweaver -i large_genome.fasta -j grammar.json --max-rule-count 5000 --stats
```

### Chunked Processing for Very Large Genomes
```bash
orbweaver -i huge_genome.fasta -j grammar.json --chunk-size 5000000 --chunk-overlap 10000
```

### Streaming Mode for Memory Efficiency
```bash
orbweaver -i huge_genome.fasta -j grammar.json --streaming --max-rule-count 5000
```

### Adaptive Chunking for Complex Genomes
```bash
orbweaver -i complex_genome.fasta -j grammar.json --adaptive-chunking --max-memory-per-chunk-mb 2000
```

### Processing Specific Sequences from Multi-FASTA
```bash
# Process only the first and third sequences (0-based indexing)
orbweaver -i multiple_genomes.fasta -j output.json --sequence-indices 0,2 --stats
```

### Maximum Memory Efficiency for Extremely Large Genomes
```bash
orbweaver -i ultra_large_genome.fasta -j grammar.json \
  --streaming \
  --adaptive-chunking \
  --max-memory-per-chunk-mb 1000 \
  --max-rule-count 10000 \
  --min-rule-usage 5
```

### GPU-Accelerated Processing
```bash
./orbweaver --input-files input.fasta --stats # GPU is used by default if available
# To disable:
./orbweaver --input-files input.fasta --stats --no-gpu
```

### Using the Run Script for Common Workflows
```bash
# Basic usage
./scripts/run.sh basic --input=input.fasta

# Memory-efficient processing
./scripts/run.sh memory --input=large_genome.fasta

# Complete output formats
./scripts/run.sh full --input=input.fasta --output=results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Issues

If you encounter "out of memory" errors:

1. Enable rule eviction with `--max-rule-count`
2. Use streaming mode with `--streaming`
3. Enable adaptive chunking with `--adaptive-chunking`
4. Set a memory limit with `--max-memory-per-chunk-mb`
5. Increase the `--min-rule-usage` value to reduce the number of rules generated

### Visualization

To generate visualizations from the DOT file:
```bash
# Generate PNG image
dot -Tpng grammar.dot -o grammar.png

# Generate SVG (for better scalability)
dot -Tsvg grammar.dot -o grammar.svg
```

## Performance Tips

1. Always use a release build for production: `cargo build --release`
2. For large genomes, the `--use-encoding` flag significantly reduces memory usage
3. The `--reverse-aware` option can improve compression but slightly increases processing time
4. Increase `--min-rule-usage` to reduce grammar size at the cost of compression ratio
5. Set an appropriate `--max-rule-count` based on your system's memory limitations
6. For processing multiple files, start with smaller genomes to tune parameters
7. Consider using `--adaptive-chunking` when processing genomes with varying complexity
8. Use `--sequence-indices` to process only the specific sequences you need
9. Enable GPU acceleration with `--use-gpu` for faster processing of large sequences

```bash
./target/release/orbweaver --help
```

### GPU Acceleration

Orbweaver supports GPU acceleration for computationally intensive operations using OpenCL. To enable:

```bash
orbweaver -i input.fasta -j output.json --use-gpu
```

#### What's accelerated on the GPU:

1. **Digram Finding**: The most frequent pattern finding process, which is core to grammar construction, is accelerated with parallel digram counting and hash computation.
   
2. **Suffix Array Construction**: Suffix arrays are built in parallel using an efficient prefix doubling algorithm, significantly speeding up work on large sequences.

#### Requirements:

- OpenCL-compatible GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel)
- Appropriate drivers installed:
  - NVIDIA: CUDA drivers with OpenCL support
  - AMD: ROCm or Catalyst/Adrenalin drivers
  - Intel: Latest graphics drivers

Run `clinfo` to verify your system's OpenCL configuration.

#### Performance Considerations:

- GPU acceleration provides the most benefit for sequences larger than 10MB
- Small sequences may see minimal or even negative speedup due to data transfer overhead
- Best results are typically seen with large, complex genomes (100MB+)

If no compatible GPU is detected, Orbweaver will automatically fall back to CPU-based OpenCL or pure CPU processing.

*   `--reverse-aware`: If present, treats a digram and its reverse complement as equivalent when finding frequent pairs for rule creation. Default is true.
*   `--export-blocks <PATH>`: Optional. Path to write a FASTA file where each record represents a rule and its fully expanded base sequence.
*   `--output-gfa <PATH>`: Optional. Path to write the grammar in GFAv1 format.
*   `--output-text <PATH>`: Optional. Path to write the grammar in a human-readable text format, showing the final sequence and rule definitions.
*   `--visualize <PATH>`: Optional. Path to write the grammar structure in DOT format, suitable for visualization with Graphviz.
*   `--stats`: If present, calculates and prints statistics about the grammar (rule count, depth, compression ratio) to standard output after processing.
*   `--use-encoding`: If present, uses 2-bit encoding for DNA sequences to reduce memory usage. Default is true.
*   `--streaming`: If present, processes the FASTA file in streaming mode (low memory usage). Default is false.
*   `--adaptive-chunking`: If present, enables adaptive chunking (dynamically adjusts chunk sizes based on sequence complexity). Default is false.
*   `--sequence-indices <LIST>`: Comma-separated list of indices of sequences to process (0-based).
*   `--max-memory-per-chunk-mb <SIZE>`: Maximum memory usage per chunk in MB.
*   `--threads <COUNT>`: Number of threads to use for parallel processing.
*   `--use-gpu`: If present, enables GPU acceleration for computationally intensive operations.
*   `-h, --help`: Prints the help message.
*   `-V, --version`: Prints the version of the tool.
